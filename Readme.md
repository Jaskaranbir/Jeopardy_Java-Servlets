Description
-----------------

A simple jeopardy game developed as part of my college project using java servlets and JSP (not my favorite stack).

### Live Demo

The game is deployed on free subscription (as Web App) on Azure. Hence the resources available are very limited. It might take a few seconds for the application webpage to load initially since the VM goes to "suspend" mode after a while of inactivity, and has to be started again.

Additionally, daily CPU time is limited to 60 minutes. [*Here*][1] are more details regarding free limitations and other variants.

Finally, [**here**][2] is the live demo! (Can be played by multiple clients for multiplayer experience).

Current Status
-----------------

Requires code structural optimization.

-----------------

**TODO:**

[ ] Replace Scriptlets with JSTL/EL

[ ] Organize file names for JSP files
